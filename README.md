# Solar System Simulation -2020
> 📌 Note: This is one of the old projects created for experimenting with sprite animations, orbital mechanics, and collision effects using p5.js and p5.play.

📖 Overview

This project simulates a mini solar system where the sun is at the centre, and the planets orbit around it. The sun gradually grows in size over time, and when it touches a planet, the planet gets destroyed (absorbed by the sun). This mimics a gravitational pull and collision effect in a simple, visual way.

✨ Features

🌞 Sun expansion – the sun grows slowly frame by frame.

🪐 Planetary orbits – Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune revolve around the sun.

💥 Collision detection – when the sun touches a planet, the planet disappears.

🎮 Sprite-based design – each celestial body uses an image for a realistic effect.

⚙️ Dynamic animation – orbits use trigonometric functions (cos, sin) to simulate circular motion.
